# Deployed Data Science State Employee analyzer


## Introduction
The objective this project is to analyze the prices of cars sold by car Dekho and determine how the price of a vehicle relates to the features and statistics of a vehicle. My teammate and I were interested in seeing how factors such as year made, km driven, fuel, seller, transmission and owner impact the price of a car you buy. Our goal was to deploy our findings to an app, but due to limited time, and balancing other projects on top of this one, that goal was sadly slightly out of reach

As briefly mentioned above, this project was inspired by our curiosity of how second hand vehicles are priced. Both members of our team have an interest in cars and thought this would be a project that would maintain our interest and possibly prove useful when buying a car post graduation. To analyze my dataset, I'll be utilizing numpy/panda and scikit.

## Selection of Data

The model processing and training were conducted using a Jupyter Notebook and are available [here](https://jupyter.cs.wit.edu/user/serpaw/notebooks/Car%20Data.ipynb). This dataset consists of 4,340 entries that consist of the cars that are currently listed on the cardekho's website. Each data point also resides within 8 columns. These columns are; Name, Year, Selling_Price, Km_driven, Fuel, Seller_Type, Transmission and Owner. If you wish to see the website that the cars within this dataset are found click [here](https://www.cardekho.com/).

The dataset .csv file can be found online at [git](insert link) as well.

Our data set has categorical features in all 6 columns. As suggested in the sample project, we utilized OneHotEncoder/ColumnTransformer on these features.\
