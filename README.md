# Deployd Data Science State Employee analyzer


## Introduction
The objective of this project is to take a .csv file of the Pay given to Massachusett's state employees (which is in the public domain) and analyze the data to determine if there are any discrepensies based on race and/or gender. Once the data is formatted properly, we also want to practice deployment of web app through the utilization of the Heroku platform as the service. Not only is this project a way for us to determine equality in the work force for the state of massachusetts, but it's also a gateway for us to develop our skills in deploying projects and deploying them.
